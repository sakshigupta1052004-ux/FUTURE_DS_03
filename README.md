Student Event Feedback Analysis

🧩 Overview
The Student Event Feedback Analysis project uses data analytics and sentiment analysis to evaluate feedback collected from various college events like TechFest, Hackathon, AI Workshop, and Cultural Fest.
It helps identify student satisfaction trends, highlight top-performing events, and recommend improvements for future programs.

🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze student feedback and event ratings.
2, Identify which events received the highest and lowest satisfaction.
3. Perform sentiment analysis on comments to gauge student opinions.
4. Visualize findings through charts and word clouds for better understanding.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
 1. Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)	Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
 2. TextBlob	Sentiment analysis (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
 3. WordCloud	Visualizing most common feedback words
 4. Jupyter Notebook	Code execution and report creation
    
⚙️ Methodology
   1. Data Loading: Imported a CSV file with 50 student feedback records.
   2. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and missing values.
   3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   4. Calculated average event ratings.
   5. Visualized distribution of ratings.
   6. Sentiment Analysis: Classified feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative using TextBlob.

📈 Visuals Included:
📊 Bar Chart: Average event ratings
🥧 Pie Chart: Sentiment distribution
☁️ Word Cloud: Most common feedback words

Insights & Recommendations: Derived actionable suggestions based on results.
